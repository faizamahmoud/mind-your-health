# WaterIntakeListView: A view that displays a list of all the user's water intake records, with the option to add, edit or delete a record.
# WaterIntakeCreateView: A view that displays a form for the user to add a new water intake record.

# WaterIntakeUpdateView: A view that displays a form for the user to edit an existing water intake record.

# WaterIntakeDeleteView: A view that allows the user to delete an existing water intake record.

# WaterIntakeChartView: A view that displays a chart or graph of the user's daily water intake over a certain period of time.

# WaterIntakeReminderView: A view that sends reminders to the user to drink water at certain intervals throughout the day.

# These views can be used in conjunction with Django's built-in generic views to handle basic CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations, and third-party libraries such as Chart.js can be used to generate the water intake chart.
